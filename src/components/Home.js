        ... a messaging app.  Our goal was to create an environment where people could connect to each other and share messages without being at the mercy of endless ads.<br/><br/>
        You may connect to friends by sending a <b>connection request</b> to people you know, or wish to communicate with.  Once the connection is accepted, you are ready to send messages.
        <br/><br/>
        You can also send messages to the <b>news feed</b>, which is visible pubicly to every Smoke Signals user.
        <br/><br/>
        <span className="bold italic">Smoke Signals</span> is an 'ad free' service!" No ads will be forced upon you.  Ever!<br/><br/>
        However, while we won't force you to view endless ads, we have a section where you can search out products you yourself are looking for, and self-select which ads you want to see. We are developing a great search feature, that allows you to search for type of ads by product, product-feature, Company and price and save your search criteria, so that those and similar ads are available at later visits  to the ad section<br/><br/></p>
